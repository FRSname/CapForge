# CapForge MCP Control Layer

Lets a local Claude agent operate a **running** CapForge app. The agent reads and
edits the transcript through token-guarded endpoints; the backend broadcasts
changes so the open UI updates live.

This is **Milestone A**: live transcript editing (spelling/homophone fixes and
filler removal). Style/emphasis and vision QA come in later milestones — see
`docs/plans/mcp-control-layer.md`.

## How it works

1. On startup the backend writes `~/.capforge/backend.json` = `{port, token}`
   (`backend/agent_bridge.py`).
2. This MCP server reads that file, then calls the backend over loopback HTTP with
   the token in the `X-CapForge-Agent-Token` header.
3. Agent writes hit `/api/agent/result`, which broadcasts `result_updated`; the
   renderer re-fetches and applies the change (soft-locked while you're editing).

**CapForge must be open** with a transcription loaded for the edit tools to work.

## Connecting (end users — one click)

In CapForge: **Settings → Claude AI integration → Connect Desktop** (and/or **Connect Code**),
then restart Claude. CapForge bundles its own Python runtime (with `mcp`+`httpx`) and writes the
client config for you — no terminal, no pip, no hand-edited JSON. If a client isn't detected, use
**Copy config manually**.

Implementation: `electron/claude-connect.js` (merges a `capforge` entry into
`claude_desktop_config.json` / `~/.claude.json`), exposed via `window.subforge.claude.*`.

## Manual / dev setup

Deps are bundled automatically in the packaged app; for dev:

```bash
.venv-dev/bin/pip install -r mcp_server/requirements.txt
.venv-dev/bin/python -m mcp_server.server      # run over stdio
```

Manual registration (grab the real, fully-escaped JSON from Settings → Copy
config manually — it bakes in the absolute paths for you):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capforge": {
      "command": "<bundled python>",
      "args": ["-c", "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, \"<folder containing mcp_server/>\"); from mcp_server.server import main; main()"],
      "cwd": "<folder containing mcp_server/>",
      "env": { "PYTHONPATH": "<folder containing mcp_server/>" }
    }
  }
}
```

The `-c` bootstrap puts the package folder on `sys.path` explicitly. Plain
`["-m", "mcp_server.server"]` only works when the client honours `cwd` (Claude
Desktop on Windows does not) **and** the python honours `PYTHONPATH` (the Windows
embeddable build ignores it) — so it silently failed to launch on Windows.

**Windows config location matters.** The standard Claude Desktop installer reads
`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`, but the **Microsoft Store** build
is sandboxed — Windows virtualizes that into the package container at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`.
Connect writes to every install it finds (`desktopTargets()` in
`electron/claude-connect.js`); if you hand-edit, pick the file your build
actually reads.

| `list_effects` | Effect clips currently on the timeline |
| `add_effect` | Place an animated effect (logo / lower_third / kinetic_stat / highlight / b_roll) at a time — the AI video director |
| `remove_effect` | Remove an effect clip by id |
| `render_hyperframes` | Render captions + placed effects via HyperFrames → output path |
| `list_effect_templates` | List saved reusable effect templates (cross-project looks) |
| `save_effect_template` | Save a timeline effect (by id) as a reusable template — "save this so we can reuse it" |

| `get_custom_caption_contract` | Contract + starter template for authoring your OWN caption style from scratch |
| `set_custom_caption_style` | Set a brand-new agent-authored caption style (full HTML); validated on the way in → live UI |
| `hyperframes_guide` | The HyperFrames **creative library** — caption craft, motion, type, the text-highlight vocabulary, transitions, palettes. Call with no topic for the operating model + index, then a topic id to pull on demand |

## Creative library (`knowledge/`)

The connected agent isn't the Claude that has the HyperFrames skills installed, so
over MCP it would otherwise only see tool docstrings. `knowledge/` vendors a curated,
verbatim slice of the HyperFrames creative references (caption, motion, type,
text-animation, transitions, palettes), plus a CapForge-specific `INDEX.md` that
rebinds the standalone CLI/project workflow onto these tools. It's served pull-on-demand
via the `hyperframes_guide` tool and the `hyperframes://library` /
`hyperframes://topic/{id}` resources. The `TOPICS` manifest in `knowledge.py` is the
single source of truth (and the allowlist). The `.md` files ship via the
`mcp_server/knowledge/**/*.md` entry in the electron-builder `files` list.

## Tests

```bash
.venv-dev/bin/python -m pytest mcp_server -q
```
